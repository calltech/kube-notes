Configuring the Kubernetes Scheduler

The default scheduler in Kubernetes attempts to find the best node for your pod by going through a series of steps.


Label your node as being located in availability zone 1:
kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com availability-zone=zone1

Label your node as dedicated infrastructure:
kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com share-type=dedicated

Here is the YAML for the deployment to include the node affinity rules:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pref
spec:
  replicas: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pref
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 80
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: availability-zone
                operator: In
                values:
                - zone1
          - weight: 20
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: share-type
                operator: In
                values:
                - dedicated
      containers:
      - args:
        - sleep
        - "99999"
        image: busybox
        name: main

Create the deployment:
kubectl create -f pref-deployment.yaml

View the deployment:
kubectl get deployments

View which pods landed on which nodes:
kubectl get pods -o wide
